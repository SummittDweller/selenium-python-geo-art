        I have had this puzzle solved for a few years. When I was out here before gathering the other caches I ran out of gas and didn't have the energy to get this one. Today I finished the series!!! Thanks for a fun series!!!

        TFTC. SL.  When M4ISU calls and suggests we enjoy the unseasonably warm temps in Boone county, it’s hard to say no.   Plus, I’d much rather ride in his new truck than my old POS.  We had a great day, I had all smilies and no DNF’s.  He had one, but it wasn’t there, I had previously found it.  I’m sure it got muggled with the landscaping work.  Always more fun to cache with friends than solo!  Thanks to all the CO’s for creating and maintaining these!  And thanks to friends who keep enabling my addiction, LOL.

Mark did the dirty work on this one and had it solved for the final already.  I just tagged along and helped at GZ (barely)  Everything in great shape here.  Thanks

        I went on a cache run to the Boone area with KCCG on this unseasonably warm December day.   I wound up with 17 finds and only 1 DNF.  It was a good day to get out of the house and nice to clean up a few more caches in the area. 

Thanks for the fun puzzle.   This was an easy walk today, stayed on the path until almost right to GZ.  This was in the open, but we put it in a likely spot and covered it up.  Still in good shape

        Once I heard the forecast for today I knew I had to get out and cache for awhile. Headed up towards Boone to get some puzzle caches, cemetery caches and a few odds &amp; ends caches. It was a beautiful day to be out hiking the timber and I loved every minute of it. No dnf's on the day so I was a happy cacher.

Thanks to all the CO's who placed these caches I got to chase down today. Much appreciated!  Had a great time hiking the area and getting these caches.  All were in great shape with dry logs.  Glad I got these now as opposed to when the grasses are growing.

        A nice afternoon and evening to be outside. I wanted to get 3 icons on the day, and knew I had left a few unfound up here after the last trip.  My second find and second icon of the day.  I walked the shortest distance in, but chose a different route out.  Nice change in elevation near GZ.  Coords were pretty good here, allowed me to find it quickly. A bit out of place and container somewhat exposed, but I put it back  in a way that I hope it stays hidden.

        Yeah!  Found it!  Good hide!  Coordinates were right on.  Enjoyed solving this puzzle last night.  As it usually turns out for me, I found a much easier route exiting the GZ area than approaching it.  It was a nice day out and I wanted some exercise so I more willing to that the adventurous route.  Thanks TopHat &amp; EarlGrey for the cache.

        TFTC. SL.  When M4ISU calls and suggests we enjoy the unseasonably warm temps in Boone county, it’s hard to say no.   Plus, I’d much rather ride in his new truck than my old POS.  We had a great day, I had all smilies and no DNF’s.  He had one, but it wasn’t there, I had previously found it.  I’m sure it got muggled with the landscaping work.  Always more fun to cache with friends than solo!  Thanks to all the CO’s for creating and maintaining these!  And thanks to friends who keep enabling my addiction, LOL.

Mark did the dirty work on this one and had it solved for the final already.  I just tagged along and helped at GZ (barely)  Everything in great shape here.  Thanks

        I went on a cache run to the Boone area with KCCG on this unseasonably warm December day.   I wound up with 17 finds and only 1 DNF.  It was a good day to get out of the house and nice to clean up a few more caches in the area. 

We both were needing  these two puzzle caches.   No hunters today, just carcasses

this cache is still tethered and in good shape

        I went on a cache run with the goal of three icons for another day qualified for the Triplet challenge. I wound up getting the three icons with 8 finds and 2 DNF's.  Found with stephenjha

I had solved this one last winter, or maybe the one before, but just getting around to finding it. I will work on the other 3 some other time, they will be a nice combo to go with the multi.  

As we we were putting it back, I found the lid to a match stick container on the ground, nothing else, just a lid.

        Once I heard the forecast for today I knew I had to get out and cache for awhile. Headed up towards Boone to get some puzzle caches, cemetery caches and a few odds &amp; ends caches. It was a beautiful day to be out hiking the timber and I loved every minute of it. No dnf's on the day so I was a happy cacher.

Thanks to all the CO's who placed these caches I got to chase down today. Much appreciated!  Had a great time hiking the area and getting these caches.  All were in great shape with dry logs.  Glad I got these now as opposed to when the grasses are growing.

All in all it was a successful trip but we were stymied on a few hides that didn't seem to be being maintained. This one was way off our planned route but we needed a letterbox by this CO say off we went.

      &lt;p&gt;Cache is NOT at the posted coordinates.  You WILL need to go there, read the sign on the stone, and decipher the final with the formula below.  Have fun!  Please post pics if you like, but NO spoilers.  Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;This puzzle will take you on a quick tour of Rippey.  The town is quite small, any tour would be quick.  :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the formula for the final: N 41 AB.CDE W 94 FG.HIJ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at the stone's plaque for the first few answers, then you'll have to drive around town to get the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A = # of miles on rec trail minus 4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B = Third digit in the year the railroad began running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C = Third digit in the year this stone was erected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D = Second digit in the year this stone was erected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E = Number of wheels PICTURED on the plaque&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;F= Number of animals PICTURED on the plaque&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now go drive around, the other clues you can get from your car&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;G= Number of gas pump hoses at Sparky's One Stop minus 2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now go west and find the old school. There is a new monument out front. On the north side of it, under the word Education is a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H= Third digit in that year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find the post office. There is a cluster of windows on the north wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I= number of windows on the Post Office minus 1. (Don't count the door)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find the Library, it is dedicated to J. J. Peters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J = The year of dedication minus 1992&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you should have all the info, go get the final!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;

        Yahoo, lonely cache. Hope this brings this back up for others to search for it. Really liked this cache.   The town has some very old homes.  Sun is setting so time to head home.  
Signed log, placed back at GZ. 
Many thanks to the CO for creating such a fun cache!

        Headed to Boone today after church to target the Virtual I haven't got here. Noticed quite a few great D/T combo caches, so I decided to just hang out and do some caching around the Boone area.

I scouted my map for potential locations to check for this one, then decided I wasn't seeing anything that looked too promising, so I consulted KCCG for some help. I found places I thought might be potential spots and played the right or wrong game with KCCG as he confirmed that my guesses were not correct. I then turned to look out my window and spotted what I knew was the place I needed to be! So I did an about turn and headed back. Chose one of two potential beacons and began scouring. Wasn't finding anything, so I decided to survey from somewhere much higher. Bingo! This tree has undergone some damage, and must have included where this cache was originally hidden. I spotted it on the ground. Whoo! A lonely find. I went ahead and moved it to a hiding place more fitting of the D/T, and am including a new picture of the perspective I had from the hiding spot. Hopefully it helps! 

Today is day 275 of my daily caching streak. SL, TFTC!

        Happened to realize we were REALLLLLY close to this one while looking at the cache listing. Gave it about a 20 minutes before reaching out to a couple previous finders. Realized I was at the right area, got a ton of clues but could not spot it. So either it is gone, or we have chosen the wrong hobby, or as one of the previous finders put it to me, both! We will watch this one and maybe try again.

        Out on Labor Day with kennyk4165 grabbing caches and enjoying the day off.  I wound up with 16 finds on a nice variety of caches.  Zero DNF's.  

Our 2nd find of the day and it was almost a DNF.  I had a pretty good idea we were in the right spot, but picked the wrong beacon.  Spent close to an hour here but it was worth it 

SL TFTC !

        TFTC.  SL.  Another interesting day for KCCG.  Started out early with the intention of working on my third Fizzy.  Got a few tough finds in DM before a cemetery puzzle, then a haircut and on to Boone for some hiking with kclarky165.  Started out pretty cool (but humid) then became awfully HOT before raining on my drive home.  Weird.  Thanks to all the CO's for placing and maintaining these hides for my enjoyment, especially the HARD ones!  Cache on!!
  
I'm glad kclarky165 had this puzzle figured out!  I've looked at the listing many times before, but couldn't nail down GZ.  Not only that, I wasn't expecting to find a log, just snap a pic and go.  Teamwork was the key here!

Another LONELY find for KCCG and kclarky165!  Thanks
